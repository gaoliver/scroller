# Infinite self scroller

This is just a funny project which you can see how it works by clicking here <a href="http://gaoliver.github.io/scroller" target="_blank">Hello, world!</a>

## What is that?

This is nothing but a common static HTML file, linking css and script. On that script we have functions for changing colors and making the window scroller get back to top every time we reach the end.

Also, with the first element being cloned in the end of the body, it gives us the illusion of the page being infinity scrolled and being repeated and an infinite page.
